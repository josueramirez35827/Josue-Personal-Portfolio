# Description: Josue-Personal-Portfolio
Josue-Personal-Portfolio is a personal side project that I am building completely on my own from the ground up. It will be act as a display of my skillset in Web Design by putting those fundamental techniques to practice as well as a place to show my past graphic design work. It will be composed of three different pages: Home Page, Work Page, and Resume Page. Each page will have a Navigation bar so it is easy to find what the visitor wants to see and a Footer that links to my Linkedin, Github, and email if they wish to connect with me further.

The Home Page will have a hero section with a welcome message to greet visitors to my portfolio and to explore the next sections. After that, I will have the About Me section which will give them a proper introduction to myself, sharing my design story, personal interests/passions, and the process behind the designs I have created. Next, I will have the My Work section which will highlight three of my most recent projects as primary examples for those that want a quick glance at my work. Each project will have a title, short description about the project, and an image to act as a hyperlink that directs them to the specific projects page. Following that is the My Resume section which will have my past experience, skillset, education, contact information, and a way to download a PDF version.

The Work Page will have a hero section that will have buttons to act as preset filters if the visitor wishes to view only specific kinds of work. After that, will be the work section that will display all of my work in a grid style with each having a very quick summary of the project, the title, the subtitle showing the topics the project covers and an image that acts as a hyperlinkt to the project. Each project will have its own direct section that displays information pertaining to the evolution of the project from conception to drafts to final deliverables. 

The Resume Page will have a section for my experience, skillset, education, and contact information. There will also be an option for the visitor to download my reasume as a PDF. The page will to fitted so that it can stay up-to-date on the latest projects I am creating and reformates itself when those new changes are made so that everything is displayed appropriately.
